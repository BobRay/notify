
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Notify will let you send an email notification to Subscribers on your site (or to all active users) when a page is created or updated (or just when you feel like sending them a message). Rather than sending the whole page, Notify sends a message with a link to the new or updated page. Optionally, you can specify tags for the message and only subscribers with those tags set will receive the email. Notify works in conjunction with the Subscribe extra, which lets users register at your site and manage their preferences (tags).</p>

<p>(Jump to <a href="[[~[[*id]]]]#propertiesTable">Properties Table</a>.)</p>

<p>Notify will also send Tweets to Twitter and (optionally) post the Tweets to your Facebook page. There is an option to shorten any URLs present in any of the Notify Tpl chunks using any of a variety of URL shortening services (TinyUrl, Google, StumbleUpon, bit.ly, is.gd,  and to.ly at present).</p>

<h3>What's New</h3>
<p>A number of nice features have been added in the latest version. The new version:</p>
<ul>
    <li>sends email (optionally) with the Mandrill email service (see below for more info).</li>
    <li>has Buttons to select User Groups to send to.</li>
    <li>sends mail in batches to save memory (batch size is adjustable).</li>
    <li>has much faster database queries</li>
    <li>sends email to a single user by email or username</li>
    <li>allows user tags for any field of the user profile (including the 'extended' fields).</li>
    <li>processes chunk, snippet, and setting tags in the Tpl chunk.</li>
    <li>allows resource and TV placeholder tags!</li>
    <li>installs/updates MandrillX and Subscribe automatically</li>

</ul>


<br />
<div class="box">
<h3>Upgrade Notes</h3>

<p>The new version is mostly compatible with earlier versions, but in order to use the Mandrill API, there have been some changes in the Tpl chunk structure that may affect you. All user-specific placeholders, including the unsubscribe_url, now take this form: {{+username}}, {{+email}}, {{+unsubscribe_url}}. Snippet, chunk, and setting tags are standard MODX tags. Resource Fields and TVs are now available with MODX placeholder tags:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
[[+pagetitle]]
[[+TvName]]
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>User Groups can now be entered in the form with buttons like the tags. Notify uses the sbsGroupListTpl chunk in the Subscribe category as the list of available groups:</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
Displayed GroupName==ActualGroupName||Displayed Other GroupName==ActualOtherGroupName
</fixedpre></pre>


</div>

<br />


<h3>Installing Notify for MODX Revolution</h3>
<p>
Go to System | Package Management on the main menu in the MODX Manager and click on the "Download Extras" button. That will take you to the Revolution Repository (AKA Web Transport Facility). Put Notify in the search box and press Enter. Click on the "Download" button, and when it changes to "Downloaded," click on the button that takes you back to Package Management. Click on the "Install" button next to Notify in the grid. The Notify package should now be installed.</p>
        
<p>During the installation, the Notify TV will be connected to the site's default template. If you need to attach it to other templates, you'll have to connect it manually by editing the TV, checking the boxes on the &quot;Template Access&quot; tab, and clicking on the &quot;Save&quot; button.</p>
        
<p>If you want Notify to post to Twitter and/or Facebook, you'll need to set the four Twitter properties (see below).</p>
        

<h3>Using Notify</h3>

<p>Notify uses a front-end form to send notifications to subscribers, and Messages to Twitter and/or Facebook. When you click on the &quot;Launch Notify&quot; button of the Notify TV when editing a resource, (having set the desired radio-button option) you are forwarded to the Notify resource, where the Notify snippet pre-fills and displays the Notify form. Note that sending updates with Notify is always strictly manual. No updates to subscribers, twitter, or facebook are ever sent automatically. For some people, receiving an update every time you save a page can get pretty annoying, so Notify only sends updates when you tell it to by submitting the form with one of the update options checked.</p>

<p>To launch the Notify form:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to the Create/Edit Resource form for a document</li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;Template Variables&quot; tab</li>
    <li>Select the Notify area, if necessary</li>
    <li>Select the type of update you want from the radio options</li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;Launch Notify&quot; button</li>
</ol>

<p>That will launch the notify Form </p>

<p>The Notify snippet pre-fills the Notify form. The values for the email, email subject, and Tweet come from the Notify Tpl chunks. The four radio buttons below the &quot;Launch Notify&quot; button set which chunks are used for the Email text and Tweet text. For both email and Twitter, there is a Tpl chunk for notifying users of new resources and one for announcing updates to existing resources. The two custom Tpls (one for the email and one for Twitter) can be used for anything you want. Finally, there is a blank option which will display the form with the Email text and Tweet text fields empty. If you want to change any of the default Tpl chunks, be sure to duplicate them (adding the prefix &quot;My&quot;). Then create a Property Set for Notify (see below) and set their names in the Property Set.

<p>You can change the text in any of the fields before submitting the form. If you change the text of the email, click on the &quot;Submit&quot; button without checking any of the checkboxes to see a preview of the email in the Preview window. You can't, however, add MODX tags to the message. All MODX tags are processed as the Tpl chunk is retrieved, so by the time you're entering the message, it's too late. You can add user field placeholders, however, in this form {{+fieldName}}. </p>
        
<p>When sending updates, Notify acts when you submit the form, but only when you have set at least one of the checkboxes. To send an update, just check the appropriate checkboxes, then submit the form. You can alter any field on the form, but if you do, don't use any placeholders. Placeholders are only replaced when the form is first rendered. Also, any URLs you enter will not be shortened. Again, that only happens when the form is first rendered.</p>
        
<p>The various options are independent, so you can send a single email, send a message to subscribers, or send a Tweet without activating the other options.</p>
        
<p>Notify pre-fills the email subject, email message, and Tweet fields for you, but you can put whatever you want into them. If you just want to email your subscribers to tell them what you had for breakfast, you can do that. The only page-specific information will be the URL (filled in by Notify) and any Resource Content tags that you include in the Tpl chunk (e.g. <fixedpre>pagetitle</fixedpre>, <fixedpre>introtext</fixedpre>, <fixedpre>description</fixedpre> , etc.). You're free to add, or delete any of them. In other words, you can use Notify to send any email message to your subscribers, optionally selected by Group(s) and/or Tag(s). Just remember that placeholders are not available to you if you do this.</p>

[[$CreateSnippetPropertySet? &snippetName=`Notify`]]

<p>Call your Property Set &quot;NotifyProperties&quot;. Notify already specifies that Property Set in the Notify snippet tag for you. If you use that name, Notify will also make sure to reconnect the Property Set to the snippet when you upgrade. If you use another name for the Property Set, you'll have to remember to reconnect it to the snippet when you upgrade or your updates to Twitter, Facebook, and/or the URL shortening service may stop working.</p>

<h3>Groups</h3>
        
<p>Email is only sent to active users. The <fixedpre>&groups</fixedpre> property can contain a comma-separated list (no spaces) of User Groups to send to. You can also add them to the form by clicking on the buttons below the input. The buttons come from the content of the SbsGroupListTpl chunk, which you're free to edit (see the format for the tags Tpl chunk in the next section). By default, Notify sends to members of the &quot;Subscribers&quot; User group, but you can change that by setting the <fixedpre>&groups</fixedpre> property of the snippet. Whatever is set will appear in the Notify form, but you can change it there. If you leave the Groups field in the Notify form blank when submitting the form, the email message will be sent to all active users on your site. </p>
        
<h3>Tags</h3>
<br />
<div class="box">
    <p>If you are using the Subscribe snippet (recommended), you can ignore most of this section and just set the Notify <fixedpre>&prefListChunkName</fixedpre> property to point to the preference list Tpl used by Subscribe. Notify will use the same tags and will handle them automatically.</p>
</div>

<p>The <fixedpre>&tags</fixedpre> property is blank by default, so the email is sent to all members of User Groups specified in the <fixedpre>&groups</fixedpre> property. If you enter tags in the Tags field, only users who have those tags (interests) will receive the email.</p>

<p>You can fill in the user interests for each user as a comma-separated list (no spaces) in the &quot;Comment&quot; field of the User Profile (or optionally in an extended field of the User Profile), but the Subscribe package will do that for you and it will also let users manage their own interest lists. See the <a href="[[~227]]">Subscribe package documentation</a> for more information on how the tags are stored.</p>

<p>If you are using the Subscribe package, Notify will use the sbsPrefList Tpl chunk from that package (or another chunk you specify in the Notify <fixedpre>&prefListChunkName</fixedpre> property) to put tag buttons under the tags input field. Clicking on one of the buttons will toggle that tag in the &quot;Tags&quot; input field.</p>
        
<p>If you're not using the Subscribe package and you'd rather use an extended field of the User Profile instead of the comment field, you can create two new System Settings:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
sbs_use_comment_field   (set the value to 'No')
sbs_extended_field   (name of the extended field you want to use)
</fixedpre></pre>
        
<p>You'll have to create the extended field for each user unless the Subscribe extra has done it for you. You'll also have to create a chunk to hold the list of user preferences (tags) and set the <fixedpre>&prefListChunkName</fixedpre> property to point to it. By default, the chunk used will be <fixedpre>sbsPrefListTpl</fixedpre>, which is the default chunk used for tags in the Subscribe extra. If you have created a new preference list chunk for Subscribe, be sure to set the Notify <fixedpre>&prefListChunkName</fixedpre> property to point to it.</p>

<p>The format for the Preferences List Tpl chunk is a series of <fixedpre>Caption==value</fixedpre> pairs separated by <fixedpre>||</fixedpre> symbols.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
Caption One==Option1||Caption Two==option2||Caption Three==option3
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>The &quot;caption&quot; (to the left of the <fixedpre>==</fixedpre> signs) is what is shown in the Subscribe extra Register and Manage Preferences forms. The &quot;value&quot; (to the right of the <fixedpre>==</fixedpre> signs) is what will be stored in the database. It is also be used for the tag buttons in the Notify form and is what you should use in the Notify &quot;Tags&quot; input field. Make sure that there are no spaces except in between the words of the caption and that the preferences list is all on one line in the Tpl chunk.</p>

<p>In the Notify form, clicking on a tag button will add or delete that tag from the &quot;Tags&quot; field of the form. The tag buttons shown are based on the tags in the chunk specified in the Notify <fixedpre>&prefListChunk</fixedpre> property.</p>

<h3>Require All Tags</h3>
<p>By default, a user will receive an email if he or she has a tag that matches *any* of the tags selected in the form. As of Notify Version 1.1.1, you can add a checkbox to the form that will let you select only users who have *all* the selected tags. You might have a 'developers' tag and a 'modx' tag, for example. With the checkbox unchecked, if you select those two tags in the form, users with either tag will get the email. With &quot;Require All Tags&quot; checked, however, only users with both tags will get the email. Because Notify responds to the checkbox, this option is settable on a per-email basis.</p>
<br />
<div class="box">
    <p>I haven't actually tested this, but I think if the &quot;Require All Tags&quot; checkbox is checked and you don't select any tags, no users will be selected. That combination doesn't make much sense anyway.</p>
</div>

<p>If you don't need this feature, you shouldn't need to do anything. If you do want it, and are using a customized Tpl chunk for the form (rather than the default one), you need to know that the form Tpl has changed. Just insert the following code in your NotifyFormTpl chunk.</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
<label for="nf_require_all_tags">
    <input type="checkbox" id="nf_require_all_tags" name="nf_require_all_tags" [[+nf_require_checked]]/> [[%nf.require_all_tags? &namespace=`notify` &topic=`form`]]
</label>
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>The code can go anywhere in the form, but just below the section containing the tag buttons is a good location.</p>

<p>The &quot;Require All Tags&quot; checkbox is unchecked by default. If you would like to change that, add <fixedpre>&requireAllTagsDefault=`1`</fixedpre> to the Notify snippet tag or set that property to 'Yes' in the Property Set.</p>

<h3>Mandrill</h3>

<p>Mandrill is an email service and a subsidiary of MailChimp. I've created the MandrillX class to make it easier to send mail with Mandrill. If you want to use Mandrill with Notify, you need to get the MandrillX package through Package Manager, create a Mandrill account, get a Mandrill API Key, create a subaccount called <code>test</code> at Mandrill, set the <code>mandrill_api_key</code> System Setting, and the <code>&useMandrill</code> snippet property. All of that should take about 10-20 minutes and is described in more detail below.</p>

<p>Mandrill allows you to send up to 12,000 emails per month (yes, twelve thousand!). Beyond that, there is a very reasonable charge for additional sends. Mandrill also has some very useful email analytics for you. You can track opens, clicks, bounces, and a bunch of other things.</p>

<p>Using Mandrill with Notify couldn't be much simpler. Go to <a href="https://mandrillapp.com">Mandrill</a> and open a free account. Hover over the little gear icon at the upper right and select &quot;SMTP & API Credentials.&quot;. Click on the blue &quot;New API Key&quot; button. Copy the API key code and paste it either into the input when you install MandrillX, or any time later, into the <code>mandrill_api_key</code> System Setting in the Manager (find it with the search box at the upper right in System -> System Settings).</p>

<p>Before you leave Mandrillapp.com, hover over &quot;Outbound&quot; on the top menu and select &quot;Subaccounts&quot; in the dropdown menu. Click on the blue &quot;Create a Subaccount&quot; button. Call your subaccount <code>test</code> (all lowercase). This is the default subaccount used by Notify when you install it. It assumes that you don't want all your test emails in a real subaccount. Once you are up and running, you can create a new subaccount, add &subaccount=`NewSubName` to the Notify snippet tag or its property set, and (optionally) delete the &quot;test&quot; subacccount at Mandrill.</p>

<p>One last thing is necessary for using Mandrill &mdash; you have to tell Notify to use Mandrill by adding &nfUseMandrill=`1` to the snippet tag or setting that property to Yes in the property set.</p>

<p>That's it. Once you've complete those steps, Notify will use Mandrill automatically for all its emails.</p>

<h3>Notify and Articles</h3>

<p>To the best of my ability to test it, Notify works fine with Articles. You need to attach the Notify TV to whatever template you use for your Articles posts, otherwise it works as expected. Notify will use the URL shortener specified in the Notify properties rather than the one used by Articles. The only other thing to remember is that the tags used by Articles and Notify are independent. Notify will ignore the Articles tags and Articles will ignore the Notify tags. This is intentional because the Notify tags match up with the limited list of Subscriber interests and the Articles tags are to help users find Articles.</p>

<h3>Email Log</h3>

<p>For each email update, Notify writes a log file to the <fixedpre>core/components/notify/notify-logs</fixedpre> directory. The file is named for the resource and date and time of the update. The log shows the message sent, the users and their tags, and if possible any problems in sending the email to each user. The <code>&maxLogs</code> property determines how many logs are kept. When the limit is reached, Notify will delete the oldest log. The default is 5, but you can set it to any number or 0 for unlimited logs.</p>
        
<p>When using Mandrill, no local log is kept since there is a much better log kept for you at Mandrill with some sophisticated analytics.</p>        

<h3>Setting the Notify Properties</h3>

<p>Notify has many properties, but for most of them, the default values will work fine. You'll need to set the Twitter properties to send Tweets. Depending on the URL shortening service you use, you may also have to set the URL shortener properties if you want short URLs. If you want to change the Tpl chunks, you'll want to duplicate them and use a Property Set as described above to set the properties that tell Notify their names so your changes won't be overwritten when Notify is upgraded. If you use a Property Set, don't forget to specify it in the Notify snippet tag on the Notify page like this:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
[[!Notify@NotifyProperties]]
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>The tag above is already set in the install, so if you name your property set &quot;NotifyProperties&quot; it will be used automatically.</p>

<h3>Notify Template and CSS</h3>

<p>If you need to modify the Notify Template, duplicate it and change the Template of the Notify page to your new Template. The Notify form CSS file is <fixedpre>assets/components/notify/css/notify.css</fixedpre>. If you would like to modify it, create a new file and change the reference in the Notify Template (after duplicating the Template and resetting the Template of the Notify page).</p>

<h3>Posting Updates to Twitter</h3>

<p>In order for Notify to post updates to Twitter, you'll need to create a Twitter App at the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new">Twitter Dev site</a> (if you don't have one already). Follow the instructions at that URL for creating a new application. Once you have it all set up, you can go to the the URL above and select the &quot;My Applications&quot; breadcrumb at the top left. Then, click on your Twitter username and select the &quot;OAuth Tool&quot; tab. you should see the four keys you need to set the Notify properties.</p>
        
<p>See the section above on creating a Property Set if you haven't done so already. To set the properties, edit the Notify snippet and click on the &quot;Properties&quot; tab. Then select your Property Set by clicking on the word &quot;Default&quot; just above the grid on the right. Double-click on a value to change it, and when you're done, click on the &quot;Save Property Set&quot; button (*not* the &quot;Save&quot; button). Don't forget to specify the Property Set in the Notify snippet tag as described above.</p>
        
<p>Once you've cleared the cache, you can post an update to Twitter from the Template Variable tab of the Create/Edit Resource panel in the Manager. Notify will pre-fill the Tweet TV for you, but you can edit it to contain whatever you like. Notify will enforce the 140-character limit on the length of the tweet. </p>

<h3>Posting Updates to Facebook</h3>
        
<p>Notify does not post directly to Facebook, but you can set
up an account at <a href = "http://apps.facebook.com/selectivetwitter/">Selective Twitter</a> in about 30 seconds. Once you've done that, simply add the hashtag <fixedpre>#fb</fixedpre> to any Tweet and the Tweet will be posted to your Facebook page in addition to Twitter. If you set the <fixedpre>&notifyFacebook</fixedpre> property of the Notify snippet, the <fixedpre>#fb</fixedpre> hashtag will be added automatically to the end of the Tweet and you'll see it in the Notify form. You can remove it manually if you don't want the Tweet to go to Facebook.</p>

<p>You can also use the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/twitter/">Twitter App</a> if you want to post *all* your Tweets to Facebook, but I don't recommend doing that if you're a heavy Twitter user because it will load up your Facebook page with lots of Tweets that most visitors won't want to see.</p>

<h3>How Notify is Launched</h3>

<p>There's no reason you need to know, but you might be curious about how the Notify form is launched from the TV tab of the Create/Edit Resource panel. The method is quite exotic. The Caption of the Notify TV is actually a <fixedpre><button></fixedpre> tag:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
    <button id="nf-b" onClick="nf()"> Launch Notify </button>
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>When the button is clicked, it launches the <fixedpre>nf()</fixedpre> JavaScript Function. The JavaScript source code is in the Notify plugin, which is connected to the OnDocFormPrerender event. When the Manager form is rendered, that plugin gets information about the current resource, replaces the placeholders in the JS code with the appropriate values, and injects the JS into the <fixedpre><head></fixedpre> section of the Manager form page.</p>

<p>The JS code adds the color to the button and adds the form below the button with hidden input fields containing the page info. When the button is clicked, the JS code checks to make sure the Resource has been saved (popping up a warning if it hasn't), and if it has, submits the form to the Notify page where the information is read from the <fixedpre>$_POST</fixedpre> array. It's difficult to imagine doing this in any other CMS but MODX without touching a line of the core code.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If you create a Property Set and it is not taking effect, double check the name of the Property Set and the name used in the Notify snippet tag. They must match. Make sure the Property Set is connected to the snippet. You should be able to see the Property Set when you click on the Default drop-down on the Properties tab of the Snippet. If it's not there, click on the &quot;Add Property Set&quot; button and select the Property Set. Then click on the &quot;Save&quot; button at the upper right (not the &quot;Save Property Set&quot; button).</p>

<p>If you upgrade Notify and your Property Set is no long shown in Tools | Property Sets, it may mean that the Property Set has an obsolete category. The only solution is to use PhpMyAdmin to edit the modx_property_sets table and change the category of the Property Set to 0.</p>

<p>If you following the Unsubscribe/Manager Preferences link in a test email using the same browser you used to send the emails, you'll have to log out or Flush All Sessions before doing anything else in the Manager. This is because following the link, resets <fixedpre>$modx->user</fixedpre>
, which changes the MODX session in that browser.</p>

<p>If you are testing on a localhost install, some URL shortening services (bit.ly for one) will fail to produce a valid URL. This is normal &mdash; they just don't consider &quot;localhost&quot; a valid  domain.</p>

<p>If no emails are being sent, install the QuickEmail package to help diagnose your problem sending emails.</p>
