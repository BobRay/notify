<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Notify will let you send an email notification to Subscribers on your site (or to all active users) when a page is created or updated (or just when you feel like sending them a message). Rather than sending the whole page, Notify sends a message with a link to the new or updated page. Optionally, you can specify tags for the message and only subscribers with those tags set will receive the email. Notify works in conjunction with the Subscribe extra, which lets users register at your site and manage their preferences (tags). </p>

<h3>Installing Notify for MODX Revolution</h3>
<p>
Go to System | Package Management on the main menu in the MODX Manager and click on the "Download Extras" button. That will take you to the Revolution Repository (AKA Web Transport Facility). Put Notify in the search box and press Enter. Click on the "Download" button, and when it changes to "Downloaded," click on the button that takes you back to Package Management. Click on the "Install" button next to Notify in the grid. The Notify package should now be installed.</p>
        
<p>During the installation, the Notify TVs will be connected to the site's default template. If you need them attached to other templates, you'll have to connect them manually by editing each of the TVs, checking the boxes on the &quot;Template Access&quot; tab, and clicking on the &quot;Save&quot; button.</p>
        
<p>If you want Notify to post to Twitter and/or Facebook, you'll need to set the four Notify System Settings for Twitter (see below).</p>        
        
<p>When Notify is first installed and you check the Template Variable tab for a resource, the Notify TVs may not be filled in. If so, clear the site cache and reload the page.</p>        

<h3>Using Notify</h3>
        
<p>The Notify plugin pre-fills the Notify TVs for a page when you edit it in the Create/Edit Resource panel. The values for the email, email subject, and Tweet come from the Notify Tpl chunks. You can change the text in any of the text TVs before sending an update, but be sure to save the page before sending.</p>
        
<p>When sending updates, Notify acts when you preview the page but only when you have set the Notify options and saved the page. Unless you set the options and save the page first, you'll see the regular page preview. To send an update, just check the appropriate radio buttons, save the page, then preview it. <b>Important!</b> It's critical that you remember to <b>save the page</b> before previewing or Notify will use the old settings for the TVs and your update may not be sent.</p>
        
<p>The various options are independent, so you can send yourself a test email, send a message to subscribers, or send a Tweet without activating the other options.</p>
        
<p>Notify pre-fills the email subject, email message, and Tweet fields for you, but you can put whatever you want into them. If you just want to email your subscribers to tell them what you had for breakfast, you can do that. The only page-specific information will be the URL (filled in by Notify) and any Resource Content tags that you include in the Tpl chunk (e.g. <fixedpre>pagetitle</fixedpre>, <fixedpre>introtext</fixedpre>, <fixedpre>description</fixedpre> , etc.). You're free to add, or delete any of them. In other words, you can use Notify to send any email message to your subscribers, optionally selected by Group or Tag. All resource fields are available through placeholder tags (e.g., <fixedpre>[[+pagetitle]]</fixedpre>) as well as <fixedpre>[[+url]]</fixedpre> and <fixedpre>[[++site_name]]</fixedpre></p>
        

<h3>Groups</h3>
        
<p>Email is only sent to active users. The Groups TV can contain a comma-separated list (no spaces) of User Groups to send to. You can specify them by name or by User Group ID number. By default, Notify sends to members of the &quot;Subscribers&quot; User group, but you can change that by editing the &quot;nf_groups&quot; TV and changing the default value. If you leave the Groups TV blank, the email message will be sent to all active users on your site. </p>
        
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>The Tags TV is blank by default, so the email is sent to all members of User Groups specified in the Groups TV. If you enter a comma-separated list of tags in the Tags TV, only users who have those tags (interests) will receive the email. You can fill in the user interests for each user as a comma-separated list (no spaces) in the &quot;Comment&quot; field of the User Profile (or optionally in an extended field of the User Profile), but the Subscribe package will do that for you and let users manage their own interest lists. See the Subscribe package documentation for more information on how the Tags are stored.</p>
        
<p>If you're not using the Subscribe package and you don't want to use the &quot;Comment&quot; field to store the user's interests, you can create two new System Settings (put them in the Notify namespace to make them easier to find):</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
sbs_use_comment_field   (set the value to 'No')
sbs_extended_field   (name of the extended field you want to use)
</fixedpre></pre>
        
<p>You'll have to create the extended field for each user.</p>
  
<h3>Email Log</h3>
<p>For each email update, Notify writes a log file to the <fixedpre>core/components/notify/notify-logs</fixedpre> directory. The file is named for the date and time of the update. The log shows the message sent, the users and their tags, and if possible any problems in sending the email to each user.</p>
        
<h3>Posting Updates to Twitter</h3>
<p>In order for Notify to post updates to Twitter, you'll need to create a Twitter App at the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new">Twitter Dev site</a> (if you don't have one already). Follow the instructions at that URL for creating a new application. Once you have it all set up, you can go to the the URL above and select the &quot;My Applications&quot; breadcrumb at the top left. Then, click on your Twitter username and select the &quot;OAuth Tool&quot; tab. you should see the four keys you need to set the Notify System Settings.</p>
        
<p>To set the System Settings, go to System | System Settings in the MODX Manager and select the &quot;notify&quot; Namespace in the drop-down list at the top of the grid (it will show the &quot;core&quot; Namespace to begin with). Double-click in the &quot;Value&quot; field for each key and paste in value from the Twitter App page.</p>
        
<p>Once you've cleared the cache, you can post an update to Twitter from the Template Variable tab of the Create/Edit Resource panel in the Manager. Notify will pre-fill the Tweet TV for you, but you can edit it to contain whatever you like. The  Select </p>

<h3>Posting Updates to Facebook</h3>
        
<p>Notify does not, at present, post directly to Facebook, but you can set
up an account at <a href = "http://apps.facebook.com/selectivetwitter/">Selective Twitter</a> in about 30 seconds. Once you've done that, simply adding the hashtag <fixedpre>#fb</fixedpre> to any Tweet and the Tweet will be posted to your Facebook page in addition to Twitter. If you set the <fixedpre>&notifyFacebook</fixedpre> property, the <fixedpre>#fb</fixedpre> hashtag will be added automatically to the end of the Tweet and you'll see it in the Notify form. The Facebook App will remove that hashtag in the Tweet.</p>

<p>You can also use the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/twitter/">Twitter App</a> if you want to post *all* your Tweets to Facebook, but I don't recommend doing that if you're a heavy Twitter user because it will load up your Facebook page with lots of Tweets that most visitors won't want to see.</p>
