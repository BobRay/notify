<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Notify will let you send an email notification to subscribers on your site when a page is created or updated (or just when you feel like sending them a message). Rather than sending the whole page, Notify sends a message with a link to the new or updated page. Optionally, you can specify tags for the message and only subscribers with those tags set will receive the email. Notify works in conjunction with the Subscribe extra, which lets users register at your site and manage their preferences (tags). </p>


<h3>Posting Updates to Twitter</h3>
<p>In order for Notify to post updates to Twitter, you'll neeed to create a Twitter App at the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new">Twitter Dev site</a> (if you don't have one already). Follow the instructions at the site for creating a new application. Once you have it all set up, you can go to the the URL above and select the &quot;My Applications&quot; breadcrumb at the top left. Then, click on your Twitter username and select the &quot;OAuth Tool&quot; tab. you should see the four keys you need to set the Notify System Settings.</p>        
        
<p>To set the System Settings, go to System | System Settings in the MODX Manager and select the &quot;notify&quot; Namespace in the drop-down list at the top of the grid (it will show the &quot;core&quot; Namespace to begin with). Double-click in the &quot;Value&quot; field for each key and paste in value from the Twitter App page.</p>

<h3>Posting Updates to Facebook</h3>
        
<p>Notify does not, at present, post directly to Facebook, but you can set
up an account at <a href = "http://apps.facebook.com/selectivetwitter/">Selective Twitter</a> in about 30 seconds. Once you've done that, simply adding the hashtag <fixedpre>#fb</fixedpre> to any Tweet will post the tweet to your Facebook page.</p>

<p>You can also use the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/twitter/">Twitter App</a> if you want to post *all* your Tweets to Facebook, but I don't recommend doing that if you're a heavy Twitter user because it will load up your Facebook page with lots of Tweets that most visitors won't want to see.</p>
