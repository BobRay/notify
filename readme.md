Notify was written as a companion to the [Subscribe](https://bobsguides.com/subscribe-tutorial.html) extra, which manages user registration, unsubscribing, group membership, and user preferences. You don't need to use Subscribe to use Notify, but it must be installed for Notify to work properly and it provides many extra features that work well with Notify.

Notify sends email updates to users on your site and (optionally) posts to Twitter and Facebook. The users can be selected by User Group, and/or by tags specifying user interests. The updates are manual, rather than automatic, so Notify only sends them when you tell it to.

As of version 1.2.2, Notify can use the Mandrill email service (an offshoot of MailChimp) to send email.

Notify pre-fills an update form based on Tpl chunks you can modify. During the pre-fill process, Notify will (optionally) shorten any URLs using any one of a number of URL-shortening services. For services like Google, bit.ly, StumbleUpon, and TinyURL, Notify will use your API key during the shortening process.

You can also use Notify to send free-form email messages to all registered users or to various subgroups of users.
