Notify sends updates to users on your site, Twitter, and Facebook. The users can be selected by User Group, and/or by tags specifying user interests. The updates are manual, rather than automatic, so Notify only sends them when you tell it to.

Notify pre-fills an update form based on Tpl chunks you can modify. During the pre-fill process, Notify will (optionally) shorten any URLs using any one of a number of URL-shortening services. For services like Google, bit.ly, StumbleUpon, and TinyURL, Notify will use your API key during the shortening process.
